## Project Structure

### Directory Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```plaintext
puma-website/
├── src/
│   ├── sections/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── assets/
│   ├── images
│   ├── logo
└── ...
```

### Components

This directory contains React components that make up the website. You can customize and add your own components as needed.

### Styles

The styles directory contains Tailwind CSS styles. You can modify the existing styles or add your own Tailwind CSS classes to style your components.

## Usage

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the website in development mode, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

To build the website for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized production build will be available in the `build` directory.

## Customization

### Changing Styles

You can customize the website's appearance by modifying the Tailwind CSS styles in the `styles` directory. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for guidance on how to use Tailwind CSS classes.

### Adding Features

Feel free to extend the website by adding new React components, routes, or features. Follow React best practices and maintain a clean code structure.
